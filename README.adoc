= Tick Tracking Application

== Assumptions and technical specifications

1. Past ticks with timestamp older than 60 seconds from current time are ignored with HTTP No Content status (204) and NOT considered for statistics aggrigation calculations.
2. Instead of storing all the ticks in the store, I choose to store them in a <TickStatisticsDataStructure extends ConcurrentSkipListMap<Double price, <AtomicInteger> counter>>, 

- with this approach lot of memory could be saved as we are only storing <Double> against a counter, which would be incremented or decremented when a tick in checkedIn() or checkedOut().
- as the Key is of type Double, JVM caches all Double values just like strings.
- The time complexity to find first() and last() element is only O(1)
- average() could be calculated as sum/count() which is also O(1)
- when ever tick is inserted/removed it is added/subtracted from sum which is an AtomicReference<Double> 

3. To optimally track all ticks, I choose to use the Flow.Publisher, Flow.Subscriber, Flow.Subscriptions and Flow.Supplier
to use backpressure driven approach to capture all ticks.

4. Internally ticks are entered into Priority blocking queue to order them according to the timestamp in the supplier.
5. To expire the tick, I am using a DelayedQueue backedup by Executors threads. 

== Usage
It exposes 3 service mappings
- /ticks that is a sole input end point into the system
- /statistics displays aggrigated data on all ticks
- /statistics/{instrument} displays instrument specific data on the supplied instrument.

== Building

To launch your tests:
```
./mvnw clean test

```

To package application:

```
./mvnw clean package

```

== Usage

#### Ticks injection  POST : http://localhost:8080/ticks

###### Request payload
```json
   {
      "instrument": "Google",
      "price": 100.3,
      "timestamp": 12345678
   }
```
###### Response 

```
HTTP.OK
```

#### Ticks aggrigation  GET : http://localhost:8080/statistics

###### Response
```json
   {
     "count": "1",
     "max": "100.1",
     "min": "100.1",
     "avg": "100.1",
   }
```


#### Instrument specific aggrigation  GET : http://localhost:8080/statistics/Google

###### Response
```json
   {
     "count": "1",
     "max": "100.1",
     "min": "100.1",
     "avg": "100.1",
   }
```


== Run the application normally

```
java -cp target/tickTracker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  
```
